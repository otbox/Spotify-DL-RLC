Who told you what was down here?
Come along if you wanted a peek

I've seen your face around here
Come alone, tell me under the table
What do you seek?

Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I'll sell you a dream
Oh-oh, woah-yeah
Welcome to the playground

What brings you to the lost and found, dear?
Won't you pull up a seat?
Everybody got a price 'round here to play
Make me an offer, what will it be?
Oh, what will it be?
Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I'll sell you a dream
Oh-oh, woah-yeah
Welcome to the playground
Oh-oh, woah-yeah
Welcome to the playground

Welcome to the playground

Welcome to the playground
Welcome to the playground, follow me
Tell me your nightmares and fantasies (tell me your nightmares)
Sink into the wasteland underneath
Stay for the night, I'll sell you a dream
